### Battleships
Repository for UoD assignment Battleships.

## Specification
Design and develop a Java software program to play the traditional game of  battleships.  The  minimum  requirement  is  to  create  a  text-based gamewhere  the  computer  randomly  selects  the  positions  of  the  ships  and  a human  player  attempts  shoot  the  fleet  down  in  the  minimum  number  ofshots. The standard fleet size is:
-    1 Battleship which take up 4 grid spaces
-    2 Cruisers which take up 3 grid spaces
-    3 Destroyers which take up 2 grid spaces
-    3 Submarines which take up a single grid space

The basic functionality (what the program should do) includes:
-    A menu system to allow a user to select the available game options.
-    A ‘start new game’ option where the computer randomly selectspositions of the fleet and initialises the grid. Note: the fleet positions will not initially be visible to the player since they have to guessthem. 
-    A fire shot option which allows the user to select a grid position to shoot, updates the grid to reveal whether the shot was a hit or miss and keeps track of the number of shots fired.
- A show fleet option which reveals the positions of where the fleet actually is within the grid, for verification purposes.
-    A display score option which displays the number of hits and misses that the player has achieved.
-    A Save Game option which saves the fleet and grid positions to a text file. This can be used to save a game in progress which can then be resumed and finished later. 
-    A Load Game option which loads a previously saved game and allows the user to continue playing.

## Additional requirements 
The  basic  brief  above  is  what  you  should  aim  to  achieve  initially.  If  you  have  time  and  want  to  do  more  (and  want  some  extra  marks!)  you  can  the basic problem to be solved consider some additional requirements to make a more advanced version of your game. How  can  you  make  sure  your  system  is  reliable?  How  can  you  make  it  more  user-friendly?  How  could  you  make  it  look  better?  How  could  you motivate users to start using it?
